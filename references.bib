We develop a framework in which the False Discovery Proportion (FDP)-the number of false rejections divided by the number of rejections-is treated as a stochastic process. After obtaining the limiting distribution of the process, we demonstrate the validity of a class of procedures for controlling the False Discovery Rate (the expected FDP). We construct a confidence envelope for the whole FDP process. From these envelopes we derive confidence thresholds, for controlling the quantiles of the distribution of the FDP as well as controlling the number of false discoveries. We also investigate methods for estimating the p-value distribution.},

By considering the set of true and false discoveries at the group level, this method gains power relative to sparse regression methods. We also apply our method to the multitask regression problem where multiple response variables share similar sparsity patterns across the set of possible features. Empirically, the group knockoff filter successfully controls false discoveries at the group level in both settings, with substantially more discoveries made by leveraging the group structure.}

abstract = {Survival analysis that involves moderate/high dimensional covariates has become common. Most of the existing analyses have been focused on estimation and variable selection, using penalization and other regularization techniques. To draw more definitive conclusions, a handful of studies have also conducted inference. The recently developed mFDR (marginal false discovery rate) technique provides an alternative inference perspective and can be advantageous in multiple aspects. The existing inference studies for regularized estimation of survival data with moderate/high dimensional covariates assume the Cox and other specific models, which may not be sufficiently flexible. To tackle this problem, the analysis scope is expanded to the transformation model, which is robust and has been shown to be desirable for practical data analysis. Statistical validity is rigorously established. Two data analyses are conducted. Overall, an alternative inference approach has been developed for survival analysis with moderate/high dimensional data.}

For example, in biological applications, assayed genes or proteins are grouped by biological roles or biological pathways. When studying the dependence of survival outcome on these grouped predictors, it is desirable to select variables at both the group level and the within-group level. In this article, we develop a new method to address the group variable selection problem in the Cox proportional hazards model. Our method not only effectively removes unimportant groups, but also maintains the flexibility of selecting variables within the identified groups. We also show that the new method offers the potential for achieving the asymptotic oracle property.}",

Our main theorem shows that the group Lasso  achieves estimation consistency under a mild condition and an asymptotic upper bound on the number of selected variables can be obtained.  As a result, we can apply the nonnegative garrote procedure to the group Lasso result to obtain an estimator which is simultaneously  estimation  and variable selection consistent.  In particular,  our setting allows both the number of groups and the number of variables per  group increase and thus is applicable to high-dimensional problems.  We also provide   estimation consistency analysis for a version of the sparse additive models with increasing dimensions. Some finite-sample results are also reported.}
