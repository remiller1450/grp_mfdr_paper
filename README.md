## Overview

This repository contains materials and R code to reproduce the paper "Marginal False Discovery Rates for Group Lasso Regression".

## Description

The file "functions.R" contains several helper functions used to generate data for the simulation experiments and real data case study described in the paper.  This file must be located in the same directory as "simulations.R" and "case_study.R" in order for those programs to run.

Please be aware that many of these simulations are computationally intensive and take many hours to complete.
